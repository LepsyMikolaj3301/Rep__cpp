# My CPP Repository

Here I have some minor projects and tasks wrote ALL IN C++
The most important of those is my own small cmd game - Monke, based on a 2D labirynth,
( ,generated artificcialy with 3 modes ( Easy - Hard ) ) 

Additionally, I have some minor solution to small programming tasks, regarding cpp random lib and other stuff
Some changes might be added to it aswell
